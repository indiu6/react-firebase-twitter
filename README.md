# react-firebase-twitter

## Coding Practice to remember.

As this project has little bit more functions than before other toy projects,

first implement all funtionalities to operate properly.

Then clean up, and refactor the code.

Then apply styling to components.

Finally, test CRUD to check any errors, and implement other functions by researching Google Firebase documents.
