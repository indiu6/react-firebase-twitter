## Coding Practice to remember.

#### As this project has little bit more functions than before other toy projects,

#### first implement all funtionalities to operate properly.

#### Then clean up, and refactor the code => Make sure one component do one thing.

#### Then apply styling to components.

#### Finally, test CRUD to check any errors, and implement other functions by researching Google Firebase documents.
